*The above pictures are sample outputs from projects I have worked on. For data privacy and originality reason, I only include code for my Bachelor and (part of) MScBA thesis and one MATLAB business cycle fluctuation simulation project code.*

### [Text Data Analytics: Master Thesis](https://github.com/zyeecon/Text-Mining-TIAS-Thesis)
TIAS Business School, Feb. 2022 <br/>
- Researched whether jobs that contain certain keywords, such as engineers, are key drivers of income and occupational polarization in the age of automation.
- Applied text analytics on longitudinal labor statistics dataset to obtain the number of occurences of keywords in job titles by year; Tokenized, stemmed and removed stop-words for text preprocessing.
- Created data visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib to observe trends and patterns.

### [Time series analysis: Graduate Student Researcher](https://github.com/zyeecon/MATLAB-Dynare)
University of Kentucky, Aug. 2018 - Dec. 2020 <br/>
-	Implemented various time series analysis techniques (ARIMA, VAR, and GARCH) to predict the dynamic financial responses of monetary and fiscal policy changes.
-	Investigated various simulation codes with MATLAB for DSGE-based model valuations to capture business cycle fluctuations.


### [Survey Data Analysis](https://github.com/zyeecon/Survey-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Undergrad%20thesis.%20do)
Bachelor Thesis at Lawrence University  <br/>
-	Conducted a research on an exploratory question on whether health comparisons with closely related individuals affect individuals' self-rated health.
-	Collected data surveys, built models (especialy for health comparisons), and conducted statistical hypothesis testing.
